    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remember: everytime you compile a pdf with latex, it creates a 
        change in the logfiles and you have to commit and push again although 
        it doesn't really seem like you made any changes
        \item All collaborators should have their own branch
        \item How do I change the environment used for python scripts using 
        the terminal? It does not work to change this in the Anaconda prompt 
        and open vs code from there. 
    \end{itemize}

Existing repositories for UiB courses as of 02/2023:
\begin{itemize}
    \item public: GEOF211, GEOF212, GEOF321, GEOF337
    \item private: GEOF105 (probably many more)
    \item maybe ask the owners of the repositories for potential more existing ones?
    \item professors (Ilker Fer, Mostafa Paskyabi, Kerim), researchers (Daniele, Ailin, Joao), PhDs, master students, etc
\end{itemize}

Brainstorm with Helge:
\begin{itemize}
    \item show how to reach success with the tool for the teachers
    \item show how to use with MatLab with VSC
    \item INF100 course for students with Python over Anaconda
    \item have examples to go through, demonstrations (how to upload)
\end{itemize}
