        \item Remember: everytime you compile a pdf with latex, it creates a 
        change in the logfiles and you have to commit and push again although 
        it doesn't really seem like you made any changes
        \item All collaborators should have their own branch
        \item How do I change the environment used for python scripts using 
        the terminal? It does not work to change this in the Anaconda prompt 
        and open vs code from there.
