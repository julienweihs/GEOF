## Thoughts
    - All collaborators should have their own branch
    - How do I change the environment used for python scripts using 
    the terminal? It does not work to change this in the Anaconda prompt 
    and open vs code from there.
    - compare GitHub-for-education vs GitLab (UiB environment)
    - implementation of GH+VSC:
        - GEOF105 (Kjersti + Andrea+Julien) - autumn
        - GEOF213 (Camille + Hari+?) - autumn
        - GEOF346 (Helge + Kjersti?) - autumn
        - Mostafa-course - autumn
        - Thomas-course - autumn


## Existing repositories for UiB courses as of 02/2023
 
    - public: GEOF211, GEOF212, GEOF321, GEOF337
    - private: GEOF105 (probably many more)
    - maybe ask the owners of the repositories for potential more existing ones?
    - professors (Ilker Fer, Mostafa Paskyabi, Kerim), researchers (Daniele, Ailin, Joao), PhDs, master students, etc
 

## Brainstorm with Helge
 
    - show how to reach success with the tool for the teachers
    - show how to use with MatLab with VSC
    - INF100 course for students with Python over Anaconda
    - have examples to go through, demonstrations (how to upload)

## Cambridge University Press meeting:}

Mail from Thomas:

"It would probably be most valuable if you could talk about \textbf{why integrating programming would be valuable and how you intend to support it at our department}. In general, all future textbooks should have Python exercises that go along with the material. If this is a message we could land with her and with her understanding the need and potential, this could be useful.
If you can then speak both from your perspective as a student as well as from your perspective as someone developing the Python programming that goes along with our teaching."

 
    - GEOF210 (data analysis)/GEOF211 (numerical modeling) courses last moments to have learned programming for the students
    - programming exercises printed in textbooks doesn't seem to make sense
    - CUP could think about supporting textbook narrative/theory with relevant platform for programming environment (jupyter notebook, needs to be updated); if on GitHub, open source and peer-contributed but also free, could be good advertisement; if not, link file/folder to textbook for users. What's the best interface?
    - current GEOF courses exercises could be relevant resources for a GFI-topic-textbook. We have several references at GFI.
