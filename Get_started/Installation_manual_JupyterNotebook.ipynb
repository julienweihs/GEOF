Then, in your terminal, type `jupyter notebook` and Enter. \n",

Once you've completed step 4 of the [installation guide](https://github.com/julienweihs/GEOF_UiB/blob/main/Get_started/Installation_manual_Anaconda_VSCode_Git_GitHub.ipynb) you can enter e.g. the folder Jupyter, and you'll find an exercise and an overview over rules, syntax etc in python. You can try to run through \"Del0...\" to check that everything works.\n",

    "If you want to make your own file, go into your NotGit directory and press the \"New\" button in the upper right part of the page. Select \"Python 3\" and a new window opens. Now you can start writing code and text. You can also just open a text file and change the file extension to .py, and you'll have a standard python file. \n"
